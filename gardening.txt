Dora is interested so much in gardening and she plants more trees in her garden. 
She plants trees in a rectangular fashion with the order of rows and columns and 
numbered the trees in row-wise order. She planted the mango tree only in a 1st row, 1st column and last column.
So given the tree number, your task is to find whether the given tree is a mango tree or not?
Write a program to check whether the given number is a mango tree or not. 
Input format: 
Input consists of 3 integers 
The first input denotes the number of rows 
The second input denotes the number of columns 
The third input denotes the tree number 
Output format:
 If the given number is a mango tree, print "Yes". 
Otherwise, print "No" 
Refer the sample output for formatting
Sample Input:
5
5
11  
Sample Output:
Yes
solution:
r = int(input())
c = int(input())
num = int(input())
c2=c*2
c3=c*3
c4=c*4
c5=c*5
r2=r*2
if(num>1)and(num<=c):
    print("Yes")
elif(num==c or num==c2 or num==c3 or num==c4 or num==c5):
    print("Yes")
elif(num==(c+1) or num==(c2+1) or num==(c3+1) or num==(c4+1) or num==(c5+1)):
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")
