The newly appointed Vice Chancellor of Anna University wanted to create a automated grading system for the students to check their grade. 
When a student enter a mark, the grading system displays the corresponding grade.
Write a program to solve the given problem.
Marks scored   Grade
100             S
(90,100)        A
(80,90)         B
(70,80)         C
(60,70)         D
(50,60         E
<50            F
The interval [a,b) includes all numbers greater than or equal to a and less than b.
Input and Output Format:
Input consists of a single integer which corresponds to the marks scored by the student. Print Invalid Input if it is not in the range 0 to 100.
Refer sample input and output for formatting specifications.
Sample Input 1:
85
Sample Output 1:
B
Sample Input 2:
850
Sample Output 2:
Invalid Input
solution:
m=int(input())
if(m==100):
    print("S")
elif(m>=90 and m<=100 ):
    print("A")
elif(m>=80 and m<=90):
     print("B")
elif(m>=70 and m<=80):
    print("C")
elif(m>=60 and m<=70):
    print("D")
elif(m>=50 and m<=60):
    print("E")
elif(m<50):
    print("F")
else:
    print("invalid input")
